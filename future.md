- more and useful examples
- actually re-implement the same component in jquery / angular / ember / polymer / react
  - something with data binding
  - like a shopping cart thingy? 
- clarify voice and argument a bit
- theres all sorts of other crap going on on your client side, but when it comes to building interactive UI components, we're going to be building components
- that's just the future of the web ok
- maybe move the declarative vs. imperative to the beginning?
- avoid discussing advantages/disadvantages to each
- emphasize what they have in common, not what's different
- so maybe just re-implement the module from jquery to x and then briefly show the other ones
- discuss interoperability of components
